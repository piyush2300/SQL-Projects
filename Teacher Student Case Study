Calculate the average rating given by students to each teacher for each session created. Also, provide the batch name for which session was conducted.
SELECT DISTINCT att.student_id,us.name,b.name,avg(att.rating)
from attendances as att
join sessions as s on att.session_id = s.id
JOIN batches as b on s.batch_id = b.id
JOIN users as us on s.conducted_by = us.id
GROUP by att.student_id,b.name,us.name
ORDER by 1;
What is the average marks scored by each student in all the tests the student had appeared?
SELECT user_id,ROUND(AVG(score),2)
FROM test_scores
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY 1;
4. A student is passed when he scores 40 percent of total marks in a test. Find out how many students passed in each test. Also mention the batch name for that test.
select ts.test_id, b.name as batch, count(1) as students_passed
from tests t
left join test_scores ts on t.id = ts.test_id
join users u on u.id = ts.user_id
join batches b on b.id = t.batch_id
where ((ts.score::decimal/t.total_mark::decimal)*100) >= 40
group by ts.test_id,b.name
order by 1;
